C plus gives you 3 point 5

D plus gives you 2 point 5

Prioritize understanding concepts over memorizing

Get enough sleep before exams since tired brains perform poorly`;

Consistency beats intensity

Two to three hours of focused daily study is more effective than weekend cramming

Use the Pomodoro technique with 45 minutes on and 15 minutes break
